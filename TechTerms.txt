1) Pure Android - google pixel
2) Stock Android - nokia ,micromax
3) Custom UI Android - oneplus(Oxygen) oppo redmi
4) Android one - low budget phone
5) Android Go - old version


Types of Mobile Apps
- Native -> depends on that on phone(Contacts)
- Web -> depends on web browser
- Hybrid -> on phone & also web(only for testing)
- Progressive web app -> same as mobile app present in web app(red bus,Zoom)

Data Science 
Machine Learning - starts with i/p + o/p makes solution (structured data)
Types of Machine Learning - Supervised 
                             - Unsupervised 
                             - Semi-Supervised
                             - Reinforcement
                             - Transfer
Working of Machine Learning - takes more than 1000's iteration
Lang of machine learning - R & phyton
Tools - pandas,matplotlib(visual),numpy(phyton module)
Deep Learning - subset of machine learning (neural network-simulate the behaviour of brain)(Unstrutured data)
AI - narrow AI -> good at specific task (Grammly)
     - General AI -> good at multiple task (Sofia the robot)
     - super AI -> advance than human (only theory till)
